Located within this account is all of the code and documents I used in my portfolio of data analysis projects. Listed below is a high-level overview of what I researched and accomplished within each project:

##FIFA Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis

In this project, I cleaned data through SQL. I **created views**, **altered columns and data types**, **performed case statements**, and more in order to standardize formatting, add calculated columns, and break date ranges out into 
'beginning' and 'end' columns. This allowed for more easier interpretation of the data and more meaningful analysis. After cleaning the entire dataset, I then imported the data into **Microsoft Power BI** and visualized it to uncover 
trends. Some of the visualizations I created included a correlation analysis between a player's skill level and their annual wage, the frequency of certain nationalities among professional soccer players, and the distribution of 
skill-levels among various positions.

##Collegiate Baseball Hitters Analysis

In this project, I imported data collected by the baseball program at Trevecca Nazarene University and analyzed it within Excel. I first consulted with the team's coaches to figure out what information they wanted, and what decisions
they wanted to be better informed to make. Then, I took the data provided and synthesized it into various reports and pages to offer insights into those data points. These reports included **PivotTables**, **PivotCharts**, **conditional 
formatting**, and a host of **slicers** to make it more user friendly. Finally, I combined the most critical aspects of player and team data into a clear, visually appealing dashboard so they coaches could easily review the data and
make better decisions.

##COVID Analysis and Dashboard

In this project, I utilized a public dataset surrounding COVID infection rates among various countries. I first cleaned the data through Power Query by removing duplicate data, fixing structural issues, renaming columns to give them 
meaningful names, and standardizing data formats. Next, I used SQL to analyze the data more thoroughly. I used **window functions**, **CTEs**, and a host of **SQL functions** to gain a more in-depth understanding of the data. Finally, 
I created a dashboard through **Tableau** to visualize patterns in the data and showcase the infection rates and death rates around the globe.
